# How to check if a python function is being doctested

Don't like being doctested? Just hide a "_SpoofOut" check somewhere in your code ;)

This was a fun 30 minute project on discovering new anti-debugging and anti-reverse-engineering techniques that resulted from a discussion  with my professor. Please don't use this to obfuscate your python trojans and use it to hide fun little easter eggs instead :)
